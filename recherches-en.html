        <h2>Numerical scheme derivations to simulate self-organized collective motions </h2> 
        <p>My thesis focuses on the study and numerical simulation of self-organized collective motions. We particularly focus on the Vicsek microscopic model (individual scale) and to its associated macroscopic model (population density scale).
            They describe, for instance, the motion of insects or birds and replicate the emergence of a self-organized collective motion.
            This thesis firstly aims at understanding better the asymptotical link between the Vicsek kinetic model and its macroscopic derivative, and to develop efficient and robust numerical schemes for the macroscopic models.
            The main difficulty resides in the fact that the model is hyperbolic and non-conservative.
            Therefore, techniques developed in the context of Euler equations will be extended to this new context.
            This research project then seeks to get more realistic simulations.
            On the one hand, we aim at enriching the macroscopic model in order to take into account fear or appetence phenomena inside the population.
            On the other hand, a micro-macro decomposition method will allow us to conserve kinetic aspects in the model as well as having a calculation cost close to the macroscopic model's one.
            This could enable us to simulate situations where certain space regions are dense (where the macroscopic model is best suited) and others not (kinetic model more relevant).</p>
            <p>Keywords : Numerical analysis of hyperbolic systems, non-conservative hyperbolic systems, kinetic Vicsek model, finite volume methods, micro-macro numerical methods.</p>
